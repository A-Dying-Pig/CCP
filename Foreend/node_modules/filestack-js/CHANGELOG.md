# filestack-js changelog

## 0.11.2 (2018-01-24)
**Picker changes**
- Prevent ICC profile from being stripped on transformed images
- Update Norwegian translations

## 0.11.1 (2018-01-18)
**Picker changes**
- Fix a regression introduced in 0.10 where deselection of files prevented further uploads

## 0.11.0 (2018-01-12)
**Picker changes**
- Remove global event handlers from drop pane components on destroy

**Client changes**
- Update `preview` to use the new file viewer service (/preview instead of /api/preview)
- Update `preview` to support storage aliases (e.g. src://my-alias/my-file)
- Add preview option `v1` for users who wish to continue using the deprecated file viewer

**Note**
The new file viewer has been redesigned so custom CSS may no longer work as intended. Users can continue
using the old viewer by passing `{ v1: true }` in the `client.preview` options.

## 0.10.1 (2017-12-14)
**Picker changes**
- Fix regression with `uploadConfig.timeout` not being respected

## 0.10.0 (2017-12-07)
**Picker changes**
- Add new option `concurrency` to control maximum amount of running uploads
- Fix a memory issue related to image resize and upload concurrency
- Fix issue where `'fallback'` for intelligent uploads was not respected
- Fix issue where editing cloud images stripped EXIF metadata
- Fix `disableThumbnails` option to respect edited cloud images
- Refactor resize logic to provide better UX -- image resize operations no longer block user actions (like upload and edit)
- Update Polish and Mandarin translations
- Add Korean (`ko`), Norwegian (`no`), Swedish (`sv`), and Vietnamese (`vi`) translations

## 0.9.12 (2017-11-08)
**Client changes**
- Introduce `'fallback'` mode for intelligent uploads. When `intelligent: 'fallback'` is specified
parts will only go through the intelligent ingestion flow when network conditions are degraded. The default 
behavior of `intelligent: true` remains unchanged -- when true all parts go through the intelligent flow regardless of network state. 

Note: This feature still requires intelligent ingestion to be enabled on your Filestack application.

## 0.9.11 (2017-11-01)
**Client changes**
- Fix bug with form data being parsed incorrectly when storing URLs

## 0.9.10 (2017-11-01)
**Picker changes**
- Fix browser crash in Chrome when bulk resizing images
- Add some UX around currently resizing images in summary view (Upload button now says Resizing)

## 0.9.9 (2017-10-18)
**Picker changes**
- Disable drag mode on crop interface (only 0.9.8 had this behavior)
- Increase crop box drag anchor area to help mobile gestures

**Client changes**
- Add new `intelligentChunkSize` option to override the initial FII chunk size
- Increase default request timeout to 2 minutes

## 0.9.8 (2017-10-12)
**Picker changes**
- Add modalSize option for setting width and height of desktop modal
- Change image grid thumbnail styles to prevent stretching 
- Add support for CNAME for static picker files (thanks to @MichalPodeszwa)
- Fix duplicated uploads bug when `startUploadingWhenMaxFilesReached` and `uploadInBackground` are true
- Fix bug where infinite scroll would fetch files twice
- Fix issue with `exposeOriginalFile` not being respected in all callbacks
- Optimize all downloaded SVG assets for faster loading times

## 0.9.7 (2017-10-06)
**Picker changes**

- Default global drop zone to false, add new option globalDropZone to enable it
- Add exposeOriginalFile option to give access to underlying File instances
- Fix bug with allowManualRetry and background uploads

## 0.9.6 (2017-10-05)
**Picker changes**
- Implement makeDropPane for mounting a drop zone into the DOM (see README for options)
- Implement cropFiles for using the picker's crop UI on a specific list of files
- Add new `uploadId` to file metadata for tracking the file in callbacks
- Add new `rootId` to pick options for specifying an id for the root DOM node
- Fix UX bug with background uploads and summary row styles

## 0.9.5 (2017-10-03)
- Fixed a possible race condition in the module loader. See [#57](https://github.com/filestack/filestack-js/issues/57).

## 0.9.4 (2017-09-26)
**Picker changes**
- Implement `allowManualRetry` option.

`allowManualRetry` will override the default picker behavior when failed uploads occur. The modal will remain open to let users retry failed files manually. Network interruptions are also detected when this option is true, and uploads that fail due to network disruption will be auto-retried until the network returns or until a user manually retries.

The UX for the summary screen has changed due to this feature, so users will now see completed, uploading, and failed files in separate sections. This change is visible to all users regardless of the option being enabled.

Manual retry for the single image flow will land in a later release. This option currently only applies to files viewed in the summary screen and not in the transformer.

**Client changes**
- Increase upload request timeout default to 60s
